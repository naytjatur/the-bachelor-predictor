OBJECTIVE:

Predicts contestants will make it to the top 5 (I.e., how far they will get in the show) based on 1-1 dates and roses received in first five episodes.

HYPOTHESIS:

The women who received more attention early on in the season are more likely to have higher “rankings” in the show — attention from the Bachelor comes in roses received outside the Rose Ceremony (RC), I.e., through FIR (first impression rose), group date rose, 1-1 date rose.
